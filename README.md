# A-classifier-to-diagnosis-patients-at-risk-for-stroke-using-Apache-Spark.

 # Background
Strokes are a medical issue that occur in patients when blood flow to part of their brain is
blocked which may be caused by a rupture or a blood clot. This leads to the death of brain cells
and may lead to the death of the patient or neurological complications.


# Goal
The goal is to create a classifier and predictor to help with the diagnosis of patients at risk for
stroke.


# Classifiers
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
K.Mean Clustering

# Python Libs
NumPy
Pandas
Torch
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn (library for creating the predictive models)

# Prerequisite
